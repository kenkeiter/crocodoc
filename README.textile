h1. Crocodoc

A complete Ruby interface to the fantastic "Crocodoc":http://crocodoc.com/ document embedding/conversion service.

h2. Design/Features

There is another Ruby interface to Crocodoc, "crocodoc-ruby":https://github.com/instructure/crocodoc-ruby, and it's only partially functional. Its implementation does not offer a proper object-oriented interface, and only supports basic Net::HTTP requests. 

With this gem, I aim to provide the following functionality:

* A document-oriented interface. You perform operations on Document objects, which are serializable for easier database integration.
* A helper for generation of viewing sessions.
* Use of Faraday, allowing you to use whichever HTTP backend best suits your purposes.
* Webhook helpers
* System monitoring checks

h2. Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

<code>
  gem 'crocodoc'
</code>

And then execute:

<code>
  $ bundle
</code>

Or install it yourself as:

<code>
  $ gem install crocodoc
</code>
